# Kandi-cuff-board
Parametric Generation of a Kandi Cuff Beading Board

This is a Open SCAD program to create a board for building Kandi Cuffs or Pony Bead Cuffs.
This is inspired by the design of MamaKatzCrafts but built from scratch.
Because this is parameterized you can make it any shape or size you need, and if you want to use other kinds of beads you can alter the design.

Standard pony bead measurements seem to be 9 mm by 9mm by 6mm but there is a lot of variation. 

The basic function is to 
1. Make a rounded rect base that is sized for the number of rows and columns
1. Make a depression sized for the bead
1. Repeat this for the length of the board
1. Offset the next row by half a bead in the x and a defined number of mm in y
